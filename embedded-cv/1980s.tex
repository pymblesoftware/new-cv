Comments:	Scientia White Horse was a software development company 
producing accounting and manufacturing systems.
I assisted in the development of the Dental front office system.
The dental front office system had additional features such as a history-sensitive teeth-charting system. 
From existing designs I implemented accounts payable account reconciliation, accounts receivable, invoicing, and general ledger postings. The shipping container system was a very specialised stock control system. Shipping containers each have there own ID with a check-digit and may reside in yards for years or get written off such as getting lost at sea.
