Comments:	{\bf Porting/remediation} project replacing SII middleware with Tuxedo.  \\
Boris remediation project. It is a 3-tier client/server application. Apple Mac client in OOPL communicates via OpenUI to the COGS middleware. The COGS talks (via SII replaced by Tuxedo) to the Boris server which contains Pro*C code to talk to the Oracle (7.3.4 replaced by 9.2) RDBMS. The SII section I was responsible for was the SIDL which is like the CORBA \Cfootnote[blue]{https://corba.org/} IDL and is kept in a repository which is like the Windows registry. I wrote code to load SIDL to emulate the repository. The original target platform was HP and later moved to AIX.
I did a partial port to Linux to do work on my laptop.  
	
Testing of the interface to another system that communicates via ORACLE database pipes. Took a reworked C\# client that communicated via OpenUI to the SII Boris and got it to call the Tuxedo Boris from the last two contracts. Led a team of three developers. Training developers, administration, project planning, architecting solution, etc, etc.

	SNMP Support for the previous application. Wrote a server that polls a shared memory segment and dumps content to a log file to be retrieved by CA Unicenter Log Agent 3.0 and sent to the SNMP port. Also wrote a debug test harness that forces exceptions to be thrown for the “catch and send SNMP trap” code. Prototype for EJB interface for the previous application. Configuration of a WebLogic8.1 and Tuxedo8.1 server on Windows XP. WebLogic to Tuxedo (WTC) code. Java server pages to call the EJB. Ant scripts in XML to compile and deploy the EJB in the WLS. A C++ test program to call the test target service in “BORIS” as a prototype for the JSP/EJB prototype. WebLogic and Tuxedo domain configuration, on Linux, Windows XP and AIX. Documentation and support for previous projects. Maintenance work on the C++ and OpenUI OPL source code on the Macintosh client. Wrote C++ Tuxedo test harness for SIBEL interface.\\

%a modified form of DES encryption for a secure connection to the server.

%Comments:	{\bf Maintenance} on-site development at ADC broadband. This was a conversion project for ADC on behalf of Compaq as a result of a request from one of ADCs’ Pacific clients.	I ported code from Sun/SGI/AIX/HP-UX/Win32 to include conditional compilation for the Compaq (Now HP) version of UNIX (Tru-64). The code base is several millions of lines of code for a telecommunication billing system. This included spotting known issues and fixing them. It required compiling on the new platform, rerunning unit tests and fixing compile errors and unit test failure bugs.  \\

%Comments:	{\bf Maintenance work}. This was a telecommunication company that mostly built digital switches (Signal Control Processors - SCPs). I scanned the bug list in the GNATTS database, resolved the bugs and submitted progress updates. One of the bugs in the systems was a multithreaded construction/destruction bug which was related to multiple inheritance and the C++ diamond problem as can be inferred from the following code snippet and opposing UML diagrams:-
%
%\begin{minted}{c++}
%class Y: public X {}; instead of class Y: virtual public X { }; and class Z: public YA, YB {};
%\end{minted}
%
%
% Once the bug list was reduced, I migrated the code from the Orbix, ORB to the ACEs TAO ORB because the company wanted to use more open-source software and not pay for commercial licenses.  I reran the unit tests for all relevant parts of the system and worked with other team members to resolve any issues.  I rewrote the logging code which provided streams (“$<<$” and  “$>>$”  operators were overloaded) and URL style logging methods (such as “file:”, “socket:”, etc ). We had internal seminars on SS7, Voice Over IP, etc. The main customer was One.Tel which was a spectacular “dot.bomb” failure. Open Telecommunications no longer exists.  The documentation method was UML using Rational Rose, and Source code control was in CVS. Unit tests were in scripting languages such as expect, awk or PERL. \\
