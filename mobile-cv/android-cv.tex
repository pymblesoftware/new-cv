Since I have had experience with financial services and credit card processing online in one form or another since working with Plink libraries at BDE in 1997; I was able to quickly adapt to the workflows, codebases/business practices of the credit card services provided by Humm Group to provide bug fixes and minor maintenance on 192342 lines of Swift, 879 lines of Objective C, 334037 lines of Kotlin, 47,982 lines of java, excluding libraries. To develop the changes to these codebases I reviewed Figma diagrams and incorporated changes to UI elements in Android and iOS code as per the requirements of the JIRA tickets. \\

To modernise the build environment, I added Azure DevOps / Fastlane CI/CD build pipelines for a few of the apps. \\

Milieu Labs provides controls for domestic air conditioning systems. The control unit of the air conditioner is replaced with a module that receives MQTT messages from a server which is indirectly managed through a user's account on the app. 
The project added a Zone information screen. Zone state change handling which entailed unpacking MQTT Zone state messages, and translating that through a middleware layer onto the screen through the UI controls. \\

Added {\b feature} of Braintree payments integration in Swift and Kotlin in an app for NSW Government including Apple Pay and Google Pay. \\
The previous payment {\bf integration} had reportedly been problematic and the payment gateway vendor for Braintree was almost effortless. \\
It took less effort and resources than expected so I added the {\bf features} of Apple Watch and Android Gear Watch integration into the app for the NSW government. \\
Did a custom notification where the countdown timer and buttons appear in the phone notifications even on the lock screen. \\

The app communicates with an internal server, which acts as a proxy for another server that manages parking meters.  \\
Part of the credit card processing integration occurred on the parking meter servers and part was within the app. \\


The idea of the app is to pay for parking meters from the phone and be notified of the need to top up the parking meter if it is about to expire by tapping on the watch and the phone notifications. \\
Complex integration due to the number of servers involved and the number of moving parts and the level of security.\\

{\bf Maintenance} work and small projects involving C\#, Swift, Java, and Kotlin (Mostly Java on the Android side of things).   Fixed about a dozen bugs each week on Android then about a dozen on iOS the next week. The code was breathtakingly bad, if the server found no results in the database it would return 404 instead of 200 and an indication of an empty dataset in the JSON payload. \\ The server would 500 or 400 frequently on requests that worked a minute ago. \\

Somehow previous developers had considered the foreground and background of the app to be handled in view controllers instead of the app delegate, there was a lot of surreal code. \\
Whoever wrote it had no idea of the application life cycle or standard industry practices like not abusing HTTP error codes. \\
 
I was doing work on iOS, Android and ASP.NET and completing {\bf features} in two weeks they had waited 2 years to be completed.  \\

Comments: Several overlapping short-term contracts. Some clean-up of previous work for Edale, bug fixing, and random ad hoc changes.  Hand over and manage a developer I hired through my own company to take over work. \\
 Short-term work on Bluetooth tile beacons for finding car keys - type tag beacons. Another USB-based Bluetooth beacon (Sensoro) and QR code project for allocating desktop handset phones and Wifi access. Worked 3 days a week at Servcorp doing  maintenance work on an iOS and Android app that allows for provisioning of desktop handsets  and (guest) wifi access \\

Sensoro beacons, translating Chinese comments into English. {\bf Implemented feature of} Android circular reveal animation like the iOS animation. completed button handlers, differentiated between my wifi and guest wifi buttons and called different web service endpoints accordingly. Scale and slide up login animation to match the iOS version. Made UI consistent with the iOS version. Added disconnect handset screen in Kotlin. Added {\bf feature} of pull to refresh the menu on the Android version to be consistent with the iOS version. Added site features refresh endpoint call and UI update. Added background handset polling. Used to be location dependent.  Fixed refresh, device count wrong and other bugs in. both iOS and Android versions.  A branch was created in the source code control system called allow\_handset\_choice to allow the choice of a beacon/handset other than the nearest found beacon.  An extra button was added to the found handset screen. Touching this button launches another screen with a list of handsets detected.  On both the iOS and Android versions all the beacons that were available in the area are stored in collections in the bowels of the Bluetooth code. In both versions, the collections were propagated up through the software layers until they are presented in a UITableView or a recycler view and the on-item selection handlers then put the selected MAC address in place of the nearest found beacon MAC address and then call the occupy handset code which calls the web service endpoint (Function 16).\\

Half of the endpoints of the ServCorp server were in CodeIgniter and half were in Larvel in another repository. I set up a local copy of the code bases on my development machine for debugging server-side and client-side issues.\

Technologies: 	Kotlin, \\
\textbf{ 		Android developer  }\\
Comments:	{\bf Greenfield development}. Created an app that integrates financial data from all bank accounts from all banks and hits about 60 endpoints on a single web service. Created multi-dimensional build variants so there was product A, production, staging, and develop and the same for product B. Wrote about 21,000 lines of Kotlin and about 800 lines of Java in 2 months. Initially not very idiomatic Kotlin but progressively more stylistic Kotlin. Wrote JUnit tests. Used com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart to present data pulled from \\com. square-up.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0 into recycler views. Used \\ com.github.vicpinm:krealmextensions:1.1.5 to store data from the endpoints. Used Picasso to fetch and display bank icons. Used bouncy castle to encrypt data put or posted to endpoints. Used Android Account manager to store account information. Created one-time passwords to send credentials and financial data to the server. Used SSL-pinning.  Created code that read data from an end-point and dynamically created controls from it almost like a web browser. Used an Airbnb library on GitHub to do deep linking to handle frollo:// and https://m.frollo.us   \\
\textbf{Complete app start to finish} The entire app had already between done on the other platform and all decisions had been made so it was a matter of making like for like. \\

I end up creating a dozen or so branches, all different fairly trivial fixes, never code reviewed, never tested. I’m told they’re doing a hybrid app now (Cordova, JavaScript ) and my role is now “Application Architect”. I have to look at issues like the flow of data app to SalesForce to Epicor is truncating data and organise workshops with end users, and I digging around in T-SQL on SQL Server and APEX classes in SalesForce triggers and I end up churning out about 1000 pages of documentation and writing 50 to 100 lines of code in total. I hired a handful of developers. Lots of meetings, gathering requirements with end users. \\
